# Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is the distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine at the
heart of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products). You can use
Elasticsearch to store, search, and manage data for:

* Logs
* Metrics
* A search backend
* Application monitoring
* Endpoint security

\... and more!

To learn more about Elasticsearch's features and capabilities, see [product page](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

# ELK Stack
"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.
